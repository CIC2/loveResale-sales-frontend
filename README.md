## 🚀 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Install Node.js and npm (compatible version: ^20.19.0 || ^22.12.0 || ^24.0.0) .
- Verify your Node.js version using `node -v`.

### Setting Up the Project

- Install the Angular CLI globally: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- Navigate to the project directory
- Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Run the Application

- Start the development server: `ng s`
- Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:4200/`

## 🏛️ Project Structure

This folder hosts the application shell and the main building blocks. Below is a quick guide to each subfolder and when to use it.

- `core/`

  - App-wide, non-UI utilities and singletons.
  - Examples: auth services, HTTP interceptors, route guards, tokens, models.
  - Guideline: keep stateless; no feature-specific UI here.

- `features/`

  - Business/domain features and pages.
  - Examples: standalone components, feature services/state, lazy-loaded route setups.
  - Guideline: one folder per feature; encapsulate domain logic inside.

- `layout/`

  - Application shell and shared structural UI.
  - Examples: header, footer, nav bars, sidebars, layout containers, skeletons.
  - Guideline: no domain logic; focus on composition and responsiveness.

- `shared/`
  - Reusable, generic presentation components and helpers.
  - Examples: UI atoms/molecules (buttons, cards), directives, pipes, small utilities.
  - Project note: API clients are placed here (e.g., `shared/api/`) for reuse across features.
  - Guideline: keep API clients presentation-agnostic; domain-heavy APIs can move to a feature or `core/` if needed.
